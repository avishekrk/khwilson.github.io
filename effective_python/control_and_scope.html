# Control Flow and Scope

---

# Definitions

Control Flow

* How the program counter moves around
* Affecting the status of the stack
* What am I doing right now and why

---

# Definitions

## Scope

* What counts as a 'block'
* What is accessible where
* How many instances are there of a thing?

---

# Control Flow Statements

* def
* if/elif/else
* while/else
* for/else
* try/except/else/finally

---

# `def`

```python
def add_two(x):
    """ Add two to x """
    return x + 2
```

---

# `def`

```python
def add_two_if_positive(x):
    """ Add two to x if it is positive """
    if x > 0:
        return x + 2
    raise ValueError("x must be positive not {}".format(x))
```

---

# `def`

```python
def add_two_to_file_rows(filename):
    """ Add two to every row in a file cast as an int.
    If uncastable, skip it.

    :param str filename: The filename to open
    :yield: each row plus 2 if it is an int
    :ytype: int
    """
    with open(filename, 'r') as f:
        for line in f:
            line = line.strip()
            try:
                yield int(line) + 2
            except ValueError:
                pass
```

# Aside: Why might you use a generator?

---

# Aside: Why might you use a generator?

* Laziness
* Cleanup

---

# Aside: Context Managers

You can use generators for cleanup by using them in conjuction with context managers

```python
from contextlib import contextmanager
from subprocess import Popen
from tempfile import mkdtemp
import shutil

@contextmanager
def start_server(host, port):
    tmpdir = mkdtemp()
    p = Popen(['server', 'serve', '--host', host, '--port', str(port),
               '--cache', tmpdir])
    yield tmpdir
    p.kill()
    shutil.rmtree(tmpdir)

with start_server('localhost', 47474) as cache_dir:
    requests.post('http://localhost:47474', json={"key": 10})
    assert os.path.isfile(os.path.join(cache_dir, "key"))
```

---

# `if/elif/else`

```python
if x < 0:
    print("Negative")
elif x == 0:
    print("Zero")
elif x > 0:
    print("Positive")
else:
    raise ValueError
```

---

# `while/else`

We all know what `while` loops do, but there is a valid use of `else`:

```python
if a > b:
    b, a = a, b
while a > 1:
    a, b = b % a, a
    if a == 0:
        print("Not coprime")
        break
else:
    print("Coprime")
```

---

# `while/else`

* The `else` statement is useful when you're searching for something.
* It is almost always used in conjunction with a `break` statement that will cause it not to run
* Otherwise it runs, even if the loop never runs

---

# `while/else`

# NEVER USE IT!!!

## Make a function instead

---

# `for/else`

`for` loops in Python are *always* what we might call `foreach` loops in other languages.

* This is one reason why they're super slow

---

# `for/else`

```ruby
l = [1, 2, 3]
list_iter = iter(l)
next(l)
```

---

# `for/else`

Mechanically, all for loops (even in comprehensions) work by calling `next` on an iterator until `StopIteration` is raised

---

# Aside: This is also how generators work

```ruby
def add_two_to_list(x):
    for elt in x:
        yield x + 2

list_iter = add_two_to_list([1, 2, 3])
next(list_iter)
```

---

# `for/else`

So how do I get a traditional `for(int i = 0; i < list.size; ++i)` loop?

```python
elt_to_idx = defaultdict(list)
for i, elt in enumerate(l):
    elt_to_idx[elt].append(i)
```

---

# `try/except/else/finally`

Goal: Get as many and as few blocks to run as possible here by manipulating the try block

```ruby
try:
    raise KeyError
except ValueError:
    print("ValueError")
else:
    print("Else")
finally:
    print("Finally")
```

---

# Scope

Two major concepts:
* What enters the scope?
* What exits the scope?

---

# Exit: Try it out

Try creating variables inside of blocks and accessing them outside of blocks:

```python
if True:
    x = 10
print(x)
```

Do the same for `def`, `if`, `while`, `for`, `try`.

---

# Exit the scope?

* `def`: No
* `if`: Yes
* `while`: Yes
* `for`: Yes
* `try`: Yes

---

# Terrible things to note

What is printed?

```ruby
for i in range(10):
  x = 2 * i
print(x + i)
```

---

# Terrible things to note

What is printed?

```ruby
the_list = [i + 1 for i in range(20)]
print(i)
```

---

# Entry: rvals

Try reading variables inside of blocks like:

```python
>>> x = 10
>>> if True:
...     print(x)
```

Change `if` to `def`, `while`, `for`, `try`.

---

# Enters the scope (rvals)?

* `def`: Yes
* `if`: Yes
* `while`: Yes
* `for`: Yes
* `try`: Yes

---

# What happens with `def`?

What happens if we change `x` with the `def` statement?

```ruby
x = 10
def f()
    print(x)
```

---

# What about closures?

Use `class`es

* Note, the JavaScript syntax will also work
* But we don't do that because it's terrible
* JavaScript does it because of the wonky object model

---

# Enters the scope (lvals)?

Same exercise, with lvals!

```python
>>> x = 10
>>> if True:
...   x = 20
>>> print(x)
```

---

# Enters the scope (lvals)?

* `def`: No
* `if`: Yes
* `while`: Yes
* `for`: Yes
* `try`: Yes

---

# But I WANT to set globals!!!

No you don't

---

# I know what I'm doing!!!

I doubt it

---

# No, seriously

Fine

---

# Accessing the global scope in `def`s

* `global`
* `nonlocal` (Python 3 only)

Differ in how they trace through code (top-down versus bottom-up)
